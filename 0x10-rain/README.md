<p>Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.</p>

<ul>
<li>Prototype: <code>def rain(walls)</code></li>
<li><code>walls</code> is a list of non-negative integers.</li>
<li>Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.</li>
<li>Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are <strong>not</strong> walls, meaning they will not retain water.</li>
<li>If the list is empty return <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>
